        <h1><span>Order of Worship</span><span id="dateWorship">17 September 2023</span></h1>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Call to Worship</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God summons his people to worship him in Spirit and in Truth. We are lifted up to the throne room of heaven to the very presence of God.</p>
        <section id="callToWorshipHTML"></section>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Songs of Adoration</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">We join our voices with the choir of heaven, worshiping God for who he is.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Conviction of Sin</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God reminds us that he is holy, and that whoever would approach him must likewise be holy. We are therefore confronted with our sins.</p>
        <section id="convictionOfSinHTML"></section>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Confession of Sin</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">We repent of our sins, confessing them to God and endeavoring with his help to be more mindful in the future.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Assurance of Pardon</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God reminds us that he is faithful and eager to forgive all who come to him through faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
        <section id="assuranceOfPardonHTML"></section>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Songs of Praise</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">We leap for joy in our hearts and sing to God in praise for such undeserved grace.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Invitation to Pray</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God invites us to cast all our anxieties and necessities on him, because he cares for us.</p>
        <section id="invitationToPrayHTML"></section>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Prayer of the Congregation</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">We lay bare our hearts to God, committing our hopes and fears, our needs and desires, into his wise and capable hands.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Reading of the Word</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God speaks to us through his Word.</p>
        <section id="readingOfTheWordHTML"></section>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Prayer for Illumination</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">Having hearts that are still slow to believe, we ask God for help &#45; that by his Holy Spirit we would be able to hear his Word and do what it says.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Preaching of the Word</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God speaks to us through his messenger, telling us once again who he is, what he has done, and what he requires of us.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Baptism</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God seals his promise to us â€” that just as water washes away dirt, he will wash away sin from all who receive the gospel in faith, by the blood of Jesus through the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Confirmation</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">We embrace for ourselves the faith of our parents, confessing with our mouths that Jesus is Lord,  believing in our hearts that God raised him from the dead, and resting in the Spirit for the forgiveness and fruit promised in the gospel of grace.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">The Lord's Supper</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God addresses our other senses, allowing us to see, touch, taste, and smell the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We sit down at the table of fellowship with him, enjoying the peace in which we now stand and remembering what it cost.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Songs of Thanksgiving</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">We give God the praise that is his due: for who he is, what he has done, and what he continues to do for us in Christ Jesus through the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Offering</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">We continue our grateful response by giving God a token of what he has graciously given to us, acknowledging that everything we are and everything we have comes from him and belongs to him.</p>
        <h2 class="liturgyElement">Benediction</h2>
        <p class="liturgyDefinition">God places his name upon us and sends us back into this fallen, sinful world with his blessing and the promise that he will be with us always.</p>
